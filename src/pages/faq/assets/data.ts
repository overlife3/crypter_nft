    title: "Does Stacks provide hosting for NFTs?",
    details: `No, Stacks does not directly host NFTs. Instead, NFTs are typically stored on decentralized storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or Arweave. When you mint an NFT on Stacks, the metadata and asset file are linked to a secure, permanent storage location, ensuring their availability even if the original creator goes offline.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Where are my NFTs stored?",
    details: `Your NFTs are stored on the blockchain, with the actual asset files (images, videos, or other digital content) usually hosted on decentralized networks like IPFS or Arweave. The blockchain records ownership and transaction history, ensuring your NFTs remain secure and verifiable.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Can I host my own NFT metadata?",
    details: `Yes, if you prefer more control, you can host your own NFT metadata on a private server or a decentralized storage provider like IPFS. However, for long-term reliability, we recommend using established decentralized storage solutions that prevent data loss and ensure permanent accessibility.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What happens if the hosting service goes down?",
    details: `If an NFT's metadata or asset is hosted on a centralized server and that server goes down, the NFT may become temporarily inaccessible. However, if stored on decentralized solutions like IPFS or Arweave, redundancy ensures that the content remains available. That’s why Stacks encourages the use of decentralized hosting for better security and longevity.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Can I migrate my NFTs to a different hosting solution?",
    details: `Yes, you can update the metadata of your NFTs to point to a new storage location, provided the NFT standard used allows metadata updates. Some blockchains lock metadata permanently, so make sure to check your NFT’s smart contract specifications before migrating.`,
